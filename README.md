# bucket-sort
Task: write the function bucketSort which sorts an array using "Bucket Sort" algorithm and the function msBits.  

The function bucketSort takes an array (of type integer slice, []int) as first input value and a function as second input value.  

The function msBits takes an array (of type integer slice, []int) as first input value, some element (of type int) of this array as second input value and returns number (of type int) of bucket to put this element.  

Use "Bucket Sort" to sort all buckets.
